# About AADL

Developed by a SAE International sponsored committee of experts, the Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL) was approved and published as SAE Standard AS-5506 in November 2004. Version 2.1 of the standard was published in Sept 2012.

The AADL is designed for the specification, analysis, automated integration and code generation of real-time performance-critical (timing, safety, schedulability, fault tolerant, security, etc.) distributed computer systems. It provides a new vehicle to allow analysis of system designs (and system of systems) prior to development and supports a model-based, model-driven development approach throughout the system life cycle.

## Current list of standards

* the ARINC653, Code generation, and the EMV2 annexes from [AS5506/1A](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/as5506/1a/)
* the Data Modeling Annex [AS5506/2](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/as5506/2/)
* the Behavioral annex from [AS5506/3](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/as5506/3/)
* FACE™ Technical Standard Edition 3.0 [AS5506/4](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/as5506/4/)

# Benefits of AADL

The SAE AADL standard can lower development and maintenance costs by:

* providing a standard, precise syntax and semantics for performance-critical systems, so that documentation can be well defined
* providing the ability to model large-scale (multi-contractor) architectures from many aspects in a single analyzable model that can be incrementally refined
* capturing the “architectural API” needed to evaluate the effect of change, such as the emergent properties of integration (e.g., safety, schedulability, end-to-end latency, and security)
* allowing early and life-cycle tracking of modeling and analysis
* analyzing the system structure and runtime behavior, complementing functional simulation
* providing a great complement to reference architectures and component-based or product-line development
