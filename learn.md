Model-Based Engineering with AADL
---------------------------------

Peter Feiler and Dave Gluch authored the book Model-Based Engineering with AADL: An Introduction to the SAE Architecture Analysis & Design Language which covers the basics of the language and the related analysis tools. The book is `available for purchase online <http://www.informit.com/store/model-based-engineering-with-aadl-an-introduction-to-9780321888945>`_ under a hard cover or epub format.

Software Engineering Institute Resources
----------------------------------------

AADL webinar
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Software Engineering Institute `has published a webinar on Architecture Analysis with AADL <http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetID=424907>`_. The presentations introduces the main concepts of the language and also its analysis capabilities to validate resource budgets, latency and safety.

`The webinar is available online <http://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetID=424907>`_ with all the presentation materials: video and slides.

SEI blogpost articles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Software Engineering Institute regularly publishes articles on its `official blog on AADL <http://blog.sei.cmu.edu/>`_. It provides updates and informations about what is new in the language and what is the new tools or research that use the technology.

The articles are available online on the blog under the `AADL category <http://blog.sei.cmu.edu/archives.cfm/category/architecture-analysis-design-language-aadl>`_.

SEI podcasts
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Software Engineering Institute regularly publishes podcast about AADL. The podcasts feature people from different backgrounds, providing different perspectives about its use in industrial and academic environments.

The podcasts are available on the `SEI podcast series <https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/results.cfm?as_q=inmeta:AssetType~Podcast>`_ under the Software Architecture category. They are also available on the `iTunes store under the Software Engineering Institute Podcast Series <https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/software-engineering-institute/id566573552?mt=10>`_.

Research Publications
---------------------

The AADL language and tools are used in many `industrial or academic projects <https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/aadl/index.php/Projects_and_Initiatives>`_. The AADL wiki has a dedicated section that maintains a `list of existing publications <https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/aadl/index.php/AADL_Related_Publications>`_ organized by topics, years, etc.

Tutorials, Demonstrations, and Teaching
---------------------------------------

There are a few demonstrations available online. Most of them are available online and `listed on the AADL wiki <https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/aadl/index.php/Models_examples>`_. Also, the AADL standardization meeting regularly hosts tutorials and tools demonstrations. A `list of all existing tutorials <https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/aadl/index.php/AADL_Tutorials>`_ is available online.

The Software Engineering Institute also offers specific AADL-related courses. They can be delivered at the Software Engineering Institute or on another specific location. The course are presented by AADL experts that design the language and implement OSATE. They can answer very specific questions related to modeling and the AADL. For more information, please read the `related information on the SEI website <https://www.sei.cmu.edu/education-outreach/courses/course.cfm?courseCode=P72>`_.
